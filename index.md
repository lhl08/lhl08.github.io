<h1>Hi There! This is Haolin Li!</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 
and currently a research intern at Simon Fraser University (SFU), working with Prof. <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/~xingdong/">Xing-Dong Yang</a> on Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
<p>My research interest lies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), especially at solving problems from hardware side, including sensing system, accessibility, Robotics and further application in AR/VR. </p>
<p>I am a Maths/Physics enthusiast, you can find my related coursework <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/199SNkcFAMPjofPt2J0walXh88xGNQx4w/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>. To change people's daily lives GREATLY with LIMITED changes to their habits is what I am pursuing. The possibility to make a prototype into real world is how I judge whether an idea is good.</p>
